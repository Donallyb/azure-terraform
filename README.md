# Creating a Dev/Test Workspace in Azure via Terraform

In line with the teaching from Dereck Morgan's course available here: https://courses.morethancertified.com/p/rfp-terraform-azure, this project aims to help you navigate the basics of Terraform. 

You'll be using Visual Studio Code on any platform (Windows, Mac, or Linux!) to set up Azure resources and an Azure Virtual Machine (VM). The VM allows for SSH access, creating a redeployable workspace that's ideal for any of your future projects!

I've taken the liberty of modifying some of the supplied scripts to further tailor it according to my requirements. I've added additional variables such as Azure's location, source IP, and key file location to enhance the reusability of the script.
